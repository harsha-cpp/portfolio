# AWS SES Production Access Request Response

## Email Use Case Details

**Dear AWS SES Support Team,**

Thank you for reviewing my request to increase sending limits. I would like to provide detailed information about my use case for Amazon SES.

### Use Case Overview
I am requesting production access for Amazon SES to power the contact messaging system on my professional portfolio website (harshatummalapalli.tech). This is a personal portfolio site for a Software Development Engineer showcasing my work and providing a way for potential employers, clients, and collaborators to reach out.

### Email Sending Details

**Frequency and Volume:**
- Expected volume: 1-10 emails per day maximum
- Type: Individual contact form submissions from website visitors
- Peak usage: Occasional spikes during job search periods or project showcases

**Email Content:**
The emails will contain:
- Subject: "New Portfolio Message from [Visitor Name]"
- Contact form submissions including:
  - Visitor's message content
  - Visitor's name and email (if provided)
  - Basic metadata (timestamp, user agent for security)
- All content is user-generated through a contact form on my portfolio

**Example Email Format:**
```
Subject: New Portfolio Message

From: [Visitor Name] ([visitor-email@example.com])
Message: [User's message content]

Sent via portfolio contact form at harshatummalapalli.tech
Timestamp: [Date/Time]
```

### Email Management Practices

**Recipient List Management:**
- Single recipient: My personal email address (sriharshatummalapalli@gmail.com)
- No mailing lists or bulk sending
- All emails are transactional (contact form submissions)

**Bounce and Complaint Handling:**
- Since emails only go to my verified personal email, bounces are unlikely
- No marketing emails sent, so complaint risk is minimal
- Will monitor AWS SES console for any delivery issues
- Will implement proper error handling in the application

**Unsubscribe Management:**
- Not applicable as this is not a subscription service
- Visitors control their communication by choosing to use the contact form

### Technical Implementation
- Next.js API route handling form submissions
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent abuse
- Rate limiting implemented to prevent spam
- Domain verified: harshatummalapalli.tech
- From address: noreply@harshatummalapalli.tech

### Content Quality Assurance
- All content is user-generated through a legitimate contact form
- Form includes basic validation (character limits, required fields)
- No promotional or marketing content
- Purely transactional communication for business inquiries

### Business Justification
As a Software Development Engineer, having a reliable contact method on my portfolio is essential for:
- Job opportunities and recruitment
- Freelance project inquiries
- Professional networking
- Collaboration requests

The current sandbox limits (200 emails/day) are sufficient for my needs, but production access is required to send emails to external addresses beyond my verified email.

I have already completed domain verification for harshatummalapalli.tech and configured the necessary DNS records. I understand the importance of maintaining good sending practices and will monitor all metrics through the SES console.

Thank you for your consideration. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
